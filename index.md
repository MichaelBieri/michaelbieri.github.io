I'm Michael from Switzerland, a broadly interested person in technology.
My journey began with a wordpress homepage, and through the Arduino world,
I now landed in the world of digitalization and data topics.
In my professional career I have 6 years of experience as an electronic and building technology requirements engineer / project manager.
Alongside my tech pursuits, I also enjoy aviation✈️, music🎺 and sports🧭🚲.
