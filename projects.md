            <div class="company-year">Company: LAUFEN Bathrooms AG | Year: 2021-2024</div>
            <div class="section-title">Project goals:</div>
            <p>A smart building management system for ROCA IoT devices with iOS/Android apps allowing operators to control and configure sanitary ware via Bluetooth Low Energy. A web interface connects to the "Laufen Smart" cloud for monitoring, analysis, and control of products and gateways. An Ethernet/LTE gateway enables remote maintenance and control without the mobile app, developed with an external partner.</p>

            <div class="section-title">My scope of work/tasks in the project:</div>
            <p>Collecting the requirements of product owners, managing the project for the brand LAUFEN, creating APIs, training the trainee team, answering customer enquiries, creating reports for management and product owners, and creating documentation/manuals and certification.</p>
            <div class="section-title">Skills gained/Experience and how I mastered it:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication: The biggest challenge was to develop a simple system that integrates into existing concepts and also enables non-technicians/end customers to easily control and analyse their IoT devices. This required a comprehensive inventory, requirements analysis and good relationships.</li>
                <li>Microsoft DevOps: Rapid agile project progress through continuous backlog management, resulting in high-quality software and hardware via manual tests, A/B testing, and functional tests.</li>
                <li>Prototyping: Created valuable prototypes with Arduino for proof-of-concepts.</li>
                <li>Data pipeline: Developed an industry-leading IoT architecture using Azure Services.</li>
                <li>Data visualization and user interfaces: Created user-friendly interfaces for data visualization and device control.</li>
                <li>Requirements engineering: Developed end-to-end solutions that met all approval criteria and requirements for the European Union.</li>

            <div class="company-year">Company: LAUFEN Bathrooms AG + FHNW | Year: 2022</div>
            <div class="section-title">Project goals:</div>
            <p>Conception and realisation of a prototype for a touchless ceramic washbasin without a manual water tap.</p>
            <div class="section-title">My scope of work/tasks in the project:</div>
            <p>Realisation of the entire project using the waterfall method. Requirements analysis, concept development, prototype realisation, and documentation.</p>
            <div class="section-title">Skills gained/Experience and how I mastered it:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Requirements engineering: The biggest challenge was designing a solution that allowed users to operate the washbasin intuitively, without instructions. To address this, I began by developing user stories and use cases through brainstorming and workshops. I applied methods like SWOT analysis, gap analysis, and flowcharts, and modeled the process with use case diagrams. Using the MoSCoW method and FMEA, I evaluated and prioritized solutions, which were then documented in a product backlog.</li>
                <li>Prototyping: Created a valuable prototype with Arduino for proof-of-concept.</li>
                <li>Sensor technologies: Combined several sensor technologies (sensor fusion) for intuitive use.</li>

            <div class="section-title">Skills gained/Experience and how I mastered it:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Engineering: Planned and calculated HVAC systems (heating and air) for Building 1.</li>
                <li>Modelling: The biggest challenge was to combine the different areas into one model. Created coordinated and forward-looking construction models using BIM Autodesk Revit, integrated with Dalux. To reduce the complexity, we applied the top-down approach and analysed the individual areas and then found a common solution.</li>
                <li>Building automation: Developed schematics for the building automation system and integrated it into the BIM model.</li>
