        <div class="company-year">Company: LAUFEN Bathrooms AG | Year: 2021-2024</div>
        <div class="section-title">The project goals?</div>
        <p>A smart building management system for ROCA IoT devices with iOS/Android apps allowing operators to control and configure sanitary ware via Bluetooth Low Energy. A web interface connects to the "Laufen Smart" cloud for monitoring, analysis, and control of products and gateways. An Ethernet/LTE gateway enables remote maintenance and control without the mobile app, both developed with an external partner.
