            <div class="project-title">Project 1: IoT architecture "ROCA connect/Laufen Smart"</div>
            <div class="company-year">Company: LAUFEN Bathrooms AG | Year: 2021-2024</div>
            <div class="section-title">Project goals:</div>
            <p>A smart building management system for ROCA IoT devices with iOS/Android apps allowing operators to control and configure sanitary ware via Bluetooth Low Energy. A web interface connects to the "Laufen Smart" cloud for monitoring, analysis, and control of products and gateways. An Ethernet/LTE gateway enables remote maintenance and control without the mobile app, both developed with an external partner.
